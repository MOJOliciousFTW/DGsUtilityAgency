## About

DGsUtilityAgency is a terminal-based interactive application built with Textual that helps you make decisions using utility theory. Whether you're trying to justify a purchase or evaluate life choices, this tool guides you through a structured decision-making process by analyzing different life areas, time horizons, and categor
ies of impact.
After going through the forms, our utility calculator will calculate utilities that will help you make "better" decisions.

DISCLAIMER: This is just a fun tool, and proof of concept. Do not let any utilities or descisions calculated from this Agency, dictate your life.
